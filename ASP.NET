What are solid principles ?

S- Single responsibility - Each class should have single job/responsibility.
O - Open/Closed Principle. Classes must be open to extension but closed to modification.
L - Liskov principle - If class A is subtype of class B then, Class B should be able to replace Class A with out disrupting the behaviour of our program.
I - Interface segregation - Larger interfaces must be split into smaller interfaces.
D - Dependency inversion - High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both must depend on abstraction.
