To add some background, there are two data types in JavaScript:

1. **Primitive Data types** - This includes null, undefined, string, boolean, number and object.
2. **Derived data types/Special Objects** - These include functions, arrays and regular expressions. And yes, these are all derived from "Object" in JavaScript.
