# **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

A software module or class should have one-and-only reason to change.

# **Liskov Subsitution Principle (LSP)**

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

# **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**

A class is closed for modifications; but open for extension.

# **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

No client class should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

# **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.
