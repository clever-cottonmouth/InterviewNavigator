In one of my frontend machine coding interviews, i was asked to resolve below issue in hashtag#css ? Add your comments on how you will resolve this issue

play with logic in this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/gzfjyh45/16/

1. Modify the css code such that child blocks should not overflow the parent container (All child blocks should be in square shape after css modifications and they should be with in container)?
2. Modify the css to display all 3 blocks in diagonal to container.

NOTE: Should not change existing width, height & border.

Below is the logic that you need to modify.

<div class="container">
 <div class="block">1</div>
 <div class="block">2</div>
 <div class="block">3</div>
</div>

.container {
 border: 1px solid black;
 height: 180px;
 width: 180px;
}

.block {
 border: 1px solid gray;
 height: 60px;
 width: 60px;
