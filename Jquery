jQuery ready() Method
Use ready() to make a function available after the document is loaded:
$(document).ready(function(){
  $("button").click(function(){
    $("p").slideToggle();
  });
});

The ready event occurs after the HTML document has been loaded, while the onload event occurs later, when all content (e.g. images) also has been loaded.

The onload event is a standard event in the DOM, while the ready event is specific to jQuery. The purpose of the ready event is that it should occur as
early as possible after the document has loaded, so that code that adds functionality to the elements in the page doesn't have to wait for all content to load.
