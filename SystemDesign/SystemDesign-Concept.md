## **What**is**DDD?**

Benefits of DDD in System DesignBusiness Alignment: The software reflects real-world business processes, improving usability and relevance.

Clear Communication: Ubiquitous language reduces misunderstandings between technical and business teams.

Flexibility: Modular bounded contexts allow the system to adapt to changing business requirements.

Maintainability: Clear boundaries and encapsulated logic make the codebase easier to maintain and evolve.

## **CQRS**(Command**Query**Responsibility**Segregation)**

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a design pattern that separates the read and write operations of a system into two distinct models:

Command: Handles write operations (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting data). Commands modify the system’s state and typically don’t return data.
Query: Handles read operations (e.g., fetching data). Queries retrieve data without modifying the system’s state.
