# Delete Columns of a Table

```sql
ALTER TABLE dbo.Employee
DROP COLUMN Address, Phone, Email;
```

# Rename Table

```sql
EXEC sp_rename 'Employee', 'Consultant';
```

# Find Year

```
SELECT DATEDIFF(yy, '1995-12-31', '2024-08-20') AS DaysBetween;
```

## Update Multiple Columns

```sql
UPDATE Employee
SET Email = 'jb007@test.com', Phone = '111.111.0007', HireDate='05-23-2001'
WHERE EmployeeID = 3;
```

# GROUP BY

```sql
SELECT DeptId, COUNT(EmpId) as 'Number of Employees' 
FROM Employee
GROUP BY DeptId;

--following query will return same data as above
SELECT DeptId, COUNT(*) as 'No of Employees' 
FROM Employee
GROUP BY DeptId;
```

## Create a Primary Key in an Existing Table

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employee
ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Employee_EmployeeID PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID)
```

# Delete a Primary Key

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employee 
DROP CONSTRAINT PK_Employee_EmployeeID;   
```

# Create a Foreign Key

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee(
EmployeeID int IDENTITY (1,1) NOT NULL,
FirstName nvarchar (50) NOT NULL,
LastName nvarchar (50) NOT NULL,
DepartmentID int NULL, 
CONSTRAINT PK_EmployeeID PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID), 
CONSTRAINT FK_Employee_Department FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID)

# Explain indexing in a database.

Classic example **"Index in Books"**

# VIEW

CREATE VIEW sales_employees AS
SELECT name, salary

# PROCEDURE

CREATE PROCEDURE sales_employees AS

BEGIN
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales';

END

# friend salary

SELECT St.Name
FROM Students St
JOIN Friends Fr
ON St.ID=Fr.ID

ON P1.ID= Fr.ID
JOIN Packages P2
ON P2.ID=Fr.Friend_ID
WHERE P2.Salary>P1.Salary
ORDER BY P2.Salary;

# Transaction

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Deduct from Account 1
UPDATE Accounts
SET Balance = Balance - 100

WHERE AccountID = 2;

-- Check for errors and commit or rollback
IF @@ERROR = 0
BEGIN
    COMMIT;
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    ROLLBACK;
END;

# CURSOR

A database cursor is an object that enables traversal over the rows of a result set. It allows you to process individual row returned by a query.

```sql
DECLARE 
    @product_name VARCHAR(MAX), 
    @list_price   DECIMAL;

DECLARE cursor_product CURSOR
FOR SELECT 
        product_name, 
        list_price
    FROM 
        production.products;

OPEN cursor_product;

FETCH NEXT FROM cursor_product INTO 
    @product_name, 
    @list_price;

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
    BEGIN
        PRINT @product_name + CAST(@list_price AS varchar);
        FETCH NEXT FROM cursor_product INTO 
            @product_name, 
            @list_price;
    END;

CLOSE cursor_product;

DEALLOCATE cursor_product;

SQL Must Know Differences:

ðŸ”° RANK vs DENSE_RANK:
RANK: Provides a ranking with gaps if there are ties.
DENSE_RANK: Provides a ranking without gaps, even in the case of ties.

ðŸ”° HAVING vs WHERE Clause:
WHERE: Filters rows before grouping.
HAVING: Filters groups after the GROUP BY clause.

ðŸ”° UNION vs UNION ALL:
UNION: Removes duplicates and combines results.
UNION ALL: Combines results without removing duplicates.

ðŸ”° JOIN vs UNION:
JOIN: Combines columns from multiple tables.
UNION: Combines rows from multiple tables with similar structure.

ðŸ”° DELETE vs DROP vs TRUNCATE:
DELETE: Removes rows, with the option to filter.
DROP: Removes the entire table or database.
TRUNCATE: Deletes all rows but keeps the table structure.

ðŸ”° CTE vs TEMP TABLE:
CTE: Temporary result set used within a single query.
TEMP TABLE: Physical temporary table that persists for the session.

ðŸ”° SUBQUERIES vs CTE:
SUBQUERIES: Nested queries inside the main query.
CTE: Can be more readable and used multiple times in a query.

ðŸ”° ISNULL vs COALESCE:
ISNULL: Replaces NULL with a specified value, accepts two parameters.
COALESCE: Returns the first non-NULL value from a list of expressions, accepting multiple parameters.

ðŸ”° INTERSECT vs INNER JOIN:
INTERSECT: Returns common rows from two queries.
INNER JOIN: Combines matching rows from two tables based on a condition.

ðŸ”° EXCEPT vs NOT IN:
EXCEPT: Returns rows in the first query but not in the second.
NOT IN: Filters rows where a column's value is not in a given list.

Here are some SQL interview questions related to joins:

1. How would you combine data from two tables to find matching records?
2. Can you write a query to retrieve data from multiple tables based on a common column?
3. How would you handle a scenario where you need to fetch data from two tables, but there's no direct relationship between them?
4. Can you optimize a query that uses multiple subqueries to fetch data from different tables?
5. How would you identify and resolve data inconsistencies between two tables?
6. Can you write a query to find records in one table that don't have corresponding records in another table?
7. How would you merge data from two tables to create a unified view?
8. Can you explain how to use set operations (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT) to combine data from multiple tables?

These questions assess the candidate's understanding of joins and their ability to apply join concepts to real-world scenarios. They require critical thinking and problem-solving skills, rather than simply recalling join syntax.

Some possible follow-up questions to drill deeper into their understanding:

- Can you explain the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?
- How does the JOIN order affect the query results?
- Can you optimize this join query for better performance?
- How would you handle NULL values in the joined columns?
